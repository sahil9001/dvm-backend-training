# DVM Assignment : OOP

**Fruity: The Game** is the game that I have come up with for this assignment. It is a logic based number-guessing game in which you have to use the hints and clues given to you to find the value of a particular three-digit number.

### Requirements:

This game uses three modules/libraries:
- re
- random
- openpyxl

Modules re and random are bundled within the standard python library.
To make sure you have openpyxl installed, you can run this command

> pip install openpyxl

### Running the game:

Now, save the two files 'Facts.xlsx' and 'Fruity.py' on your computer **in the same folder/directory.** Now open your terminal and navigate to the that directory. The command for going to the directory for the ubuntu terminal looks like this:

> cd home/user/directory

Once you're in the correct directory, enter this command:

> python Fruity.py

The game will now start.

*For the best experience, keep your terminal in fullscreen mode.*

Hope you enjoy this game,

Shivanshu
