									WELCOME TO THE GAME!

			You are an explorer and in your journey you lost track and were trapped by someone in a haunted
			house in the dark forest. The person who trapped you likes to play games and has set one up for 
			you too in the house.The game requires you to complete certain 'tasks' in the house in order to 
			obtain the key that locks the main door of the house which is the only exit out of the house. 
			**CAUTION**: It is rumored that there lives an old fat beast in the house that goes by the name
			'Pudge'. Pudge is constantly hungry for human meat and has healing powers, so plan your actions
			acordingly.
